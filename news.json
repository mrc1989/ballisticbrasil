We're very proud of what we've achieved in the past, but it's time to move on.\n\nWith that, we'd like to thank our fan base and players who have stayed true to the game throughout this time. We invite you to keep an eye on Aquiris’ next steps, which has other games in its portfolio.\n\nThank you very much! We hope to see you later!\nAquiris Game Studio\n","feedlabel":"Community Announcements","date":1675706462,"feedname":"steam_community_announcements","feed_type":1,"appid":296300}],"count":156}}
